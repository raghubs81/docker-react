# Let Travis know the services that needs to be installed
services:
  - docker

# This section has the commands to be executed before the test run (Similar to @BeforeTest in TestNG)
# In this case, the dev image needs to be built before exeucting the tests.
before_install:
  - docker build -f Dockerfile.dev -t raghubs81/docker-react .

# This section has the commands to run the test suite. If any command exists with non-zero status, 
# the build is considered broken.
# In this case, we could run "npm run test", but the command waits for user input after running the test
# and hence shall never exit/finish.
script:
  - docker run raghubs81/docker-react npm run test -- --coverage
